# React App

This project was created as an empty React project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The `build` folder contains all the static files needed to deploy your SPA.

### `npm run serve`

Serves the production build locally for testing.\
This allows you to test the optimized production build before deploying.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Deployment

Your app is ready to deploy as a static SPA! The `build` folder contains all the optimized static files.

### Quick Deploy Options:

1. **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `build` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. **Vercel**: Run `npx vercel --prod` in the project root
3. **GitHub Pages**: Follow [GitHub Pages deployment guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#github-pages)
4. **Any Static Host**: Upload the contents of the `build` folder to your hosting provider

### Testing Production Build Locally:

```bash
npm run serve

This will serve your production build at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is busy).
